            Marco Polo Motorsports earned the fastest lap time in the Silver Class ahead of Race 1, while Auto Technic Racing went quickest in the Pro-AM Class, rounding off the overall Top 5 at the same time. Thunder Bunny Racing has shown they are a new team to watch as they once again proved their speed by rising to the top of the AM charts in Qualifying 1.
          </p>

          <p>
            Qualifying 2 saw NOLASPORT prevail both overall and in Pro-Am, while Toyota and BMW showed their strengths in the Silver and AM classes, with RAFA Racing Team and Fast Track Racing going quickest in their respective categories.
          </p>

          <h3>Silver Class</h3>
          <h4>Qualifying 1</h4>
          <p>
            It looked like Gresham Wagner had pole position in the bag in his No. 68 RAFA Racing Team Toyota Gazoo Racing GR Supra GT4 EVO2, however the driver was edged out by Mads Siljehaug in the No. 71 Marco Polo Motorsports Toyota Gazoo Racing GR Supra by 0.027 seconds in the final minutes of the session. Alex Ellis came in third place in his No. 77 VPX Motorsport Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport, with one of the most impressive margins seen so far—the Canadian driver was just 0.001 seconds away from claiming second on the grid for Race 1.
          </p>

          <h4>Qualifying 2</h4>
          <p>
            Hannah Grisham set the pace early on in the second session, commanding the No. 26 Heart of Racing Team Aston Martin Vantage AMR GT4. However, Tyler Gonzalez rose to the top of the Silver charts in the No. 68 RAFA Racing Team Toyota Supra and remained there until the end. Series veteran Kenton Koch locked in second spot in the No. 97 Random Vandals Racing BMW M4 GT4. It was a close battle for third place, as Jonathan Neudorf in the No. 3 JMF Motorsports Aston Martin Vantage AMR GT4 and Danny Dyszelski in the No. 77 VPX Motorsport Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS Clubsport both vied for it—ultimately Zac Anderson in the No. 52 Auto Technic Racing BMW M4 GT4 secured the position.
          </p>

          <h3>Pro-Am Class</h3>
          <h4>Qualifying 1</h4>
          <p>
            Matt Million rose to the top of the Pro-Am class early in his No. 53 Auto Technic Racing BMW M4 GT4 EVO and held the lead to the checkered flag, establishing a gap between himself and his competitors. Sam Craven and Anthony McIntosh were separated by only 0.010 seconds in second and third, in the No. 94 Random Vandals Racing BMW and No. 69 JTR Motorsports Engineering Toyota, respectively.
          </p>

          <h4>Qualifying 2</h4>
          <p>
            Matheus Leist paved the way in the second session, soaring into the top spot overall in his No. 23 NOLASPORT Porsche with a time of 1:40.896, setting purple sectors across the board. Parker Thompson moved into second in class and third overall in the No. 69 Toyota in the final minutes, securing a strong starting position for JTR Motorsports. Josh Green scored another Top 3 for Random Vandals Racing, lining up fifth overall.
          </p>

          <h3>AM Class</h3>
          <h4>Qualifying 1</h4>
          <p>
            The AM session was a shootout: James Clay posted an early fast lap in his No. 36 BimmerWorld BMW M4 GT4, but Allen Patten edged him in the No. 606 Thunder Bunny Racing Toyota Gazoo Racing GR Supra at halfway. Anthony Geraci (No. 72 RAFA Racing Team Toyota Supra GT4), Joseph Catania (No. 17 Rigid Speed Company BMW M4 GT4) and Alex Garcia (No. 07 Skip Barber Racing Aston Martin Vantage AMR GT4) all battled for best lap—Garcia ultimately claimed second, with Clay third.
          </p>

          <h4>Qualifying 2</h4>
          <p>
            David Ogburn led the AM class in session two with his No. 188 Fast Track Racing BMW M4 GT4 EVO, finishing just outside the Top 10 overall. Kenny Schmied powered the No. 72 RAFA Racing Team Toyota into second in class, while Charlie Postins secured third for BimmerWorld in the No. 36 BMW.
