          <p>
            Team Owner Jeff Elghanayan:  
            “After a three-season break, I am excited to get back to racing. I am presenting the car at SEMA in the Konig wheel booth with retro RS200 GTO livery I ran in the 1980’s.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Driver Nicolai Elghanayan:  
            “I have done a few test sessions already; I still have some learning to do, but I have fallen in love with this torque machine. It has a sense of honesty about it that makes it easy to drive.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Norwegian co-driver Mads Siljehaug:  
            “To finally be back with Marco Polo Motorsports racing on US ground is a true privilege, plus representing a new car and brand together with Toyota Supra GT4 I can only be extremely excited. The racing format from SRO GT4 is well known for me and Nicolai with welcoming, professional and good people. The series has grown and the competition is stronger than ever.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Car engineer John Mueller:  
            “Our team at Muellerized are extremely excited to return to the SRO GT4 America series for the 2025 season. Winning at this level always requires the best partners to work with, and continuing our relationship with Marco Polo Motorsports and the Elghanayan family is my ideal scenario, as we have a pair of the fastest drivers in GT4 competition. Our Marco Polo Motorsports race cars will rekindle a relationship with Toyota Racing Development, who share our passion for motorsports, and present our team with the highest level of support we have experienced in the GT4 series. Our Toyota Supra GT4 Evo has performed extremely well in testing—see you all at the SRO race tracks in 2025.”
